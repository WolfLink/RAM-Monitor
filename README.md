RAM-Monitor


A RAM Pie Chart for OSX Mavericks users who miss the option in Mountain Lion

FEATURES:
-RAM Pie Chart identical to the one in Activity Monitor on OSX Mountain Lion
-Compatible with OSX Mavericks (the feature is removed in the new Activity Monitor)
-Updates Application Icon in the Dock just like the old Activity Monitor
-Uses less RAM and CPU Time than the actual Activity Monitor


NOTE:
This is a rough first version I wrote for personal usage and decided to upload.  I'll work on it and polish it up a bit if it gains any attention.



EDIT:
I was working on a better version with the description and UI features that many requested as well as some additional features I came up with on my own.  Then Mavericks updated and now the app doesn't update when it's in the background.  So that was basically the whole point, to have the dock icon change without going back to the app.  This problem may be fixable, but then I also realized that Apple changed the way RAM works so much that the old pie chart isn't as useful as the new line graph.  I may come back to this project sometime this summer, but it is unlikely.  Sorry about that.
