RAM-Monitor


A RAM Pie Chart for OSX Mavericks users who miss the option in Mountain Lion

FEATURES:
-RAM Pie Chart identical to the one in Activity Monitor on OSX Mountain Lion
-Compatible with OSX Mavericks (the feature is removed in the new Activity Monitor)
-Updates Application Icon in the Dock just like the old Activity Monitor
-Uses less RAM and CPU Time than the actual Activity Monitor


NOTE:
This is a rough first version I wrote for personal usage and decided to upload.  I'll work on it and polish it up a bit if it gains any attention.
